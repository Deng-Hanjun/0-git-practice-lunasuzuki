I enjoyed this article: [AI vs Gen Z: How AI has changed the career pathway for junior developers](https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/09/10/ai-vs-gen-z/)


# Reflections
When I first decided to major in CS, there was an unspoken guarantee: study hard, learn coding, do internships, and youll have a stable life post-grad. The article points out that AI is already replacing and reshaping entry-level roles. When I was a sophomore, ChatGPT was just starting to blow up, and I didn’t think much of it at the time. But looking back now, it’s a crazy to see how much it’s evolved in such a short period. I think this article directly reflects what the majority of CS majors are experiencing today. I find this article quite relatable because it direcly addresses the uncertainty that CS majors are facing in todays job market. It makes me realize that the path that I thought would be pretty straight forward is changing faster than anticipated. Its a fun article to catch up on, also because it sparks a lot of ideas about what the CS job market will look like once it fully adapts to the AI we have today. It's interesting to think about how roles might shift or even dissapear entirely, and what new positions could be created in its place. It really gets me thinking about how quickly things could change and what skills would be most valuable moving forward.

I really liked your choice of article! It connects strongly with what we’ve been learning in class, that software engineering is not just about writing code, but also about adapting to change and rethinking our roles as technology evolves. I can also strongly relate to this article and your thoughts on it, since we as CS majors are facing the challenges of a rapidly changing job market. This made me realize how quickly roles are shifting.  Some disappearing while new ones are created every day. It helped me understand the importance of adapting fast and acquiring the skills that are most valuable in the current environment. That adaptability is really the key to staying relevant in our field.
